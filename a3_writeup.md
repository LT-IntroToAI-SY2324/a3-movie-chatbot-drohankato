# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
the search_pa_list function is used when you need to search for a specificvalue or element within a larger list of values or elements in the database.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
i added inception. It was one of my favorite movies during the pandemic I probably watched it 20 times. Its almost as hard to understand as coding in python


3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
who was in %, it covered the list of actos for anyon who didnt want to say "who acted in" and instead just said who was in

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I was thinking of creating a weather app chatbot for my next project, which would presumably work the same way as the movie chat bot by using a databse of average daily temperatures from previous years to predict the daily temperatures now.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
honestly the first few arguments were the most difficult to program but since most of the other ones followed a similar structure, it was easier to work on them the more I got done.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
no dont know how
